Folate is known to lower homocysteine levels, an amino acid that can damage blood vessels and increase the risk of heart disease when present in high amounts
Manganese, on the other hand, is a co-factor for several enzymes that are vital for heart health
Including lentils in your diet can help reduce the risk of heart disease and promote overall cardiovascular health
Apart from being heart-healthy, lentils are also inexpensive and versatile, making them a great addition to any diet
Lentils are a fantastic food choice for people suffering from diabetes or those trying to control their blood sugar levels
They have a low glycemic index, which means they cause a slow, steady rise in blood sugar levels rather than a rapid spike

6 grams of dietary fiber
